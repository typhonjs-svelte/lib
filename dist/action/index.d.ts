 *
 * - has a `resizeObserved` function as attribute; offset then content width / height are passed as parameters.
 * - has a `setContentBounds` function as attribute; content width / height are passed as parameters.
 * - has a `setDimension` function as attribute; offset width / height are passed as parameters.
 * - target is an object; offset and content width / height attributes are directly set on target.
 * - target is a function; the function is invoked with offset then content width / height parameters.
 * - has a writable store `resizeObserved` as an attribute; updated with offset & content width / height.
 * - has an object 'stores' that has a writable store `resizeObserved` as an attribute; updated with offset &
 *   content width / height.
 *
 * Note: Svelte currently uses an archaic IFrame based workaround to monitor offset / client width & height changes.
 * A more up to date way to do this is with ResizeObserver. To track when Svelte receives ResizeObserver support
 * monitor this issue: {@link https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4233}
