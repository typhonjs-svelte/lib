# @typhonjs-svelte/lib
July '23 - All common resources previously here have been moved to [runtime-base](https://github.com/typhonjs-svelte/runtime-base).

This repo will become the base repo for the TyphonJS Svelte desktop GUI. Presently this is being developed on 
the FoundryVTT platform and located here ([@typhonjs-fvtt/svelte](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib/svelte)), but 
work is ongoing to refactor this framework to be platform neutral.
